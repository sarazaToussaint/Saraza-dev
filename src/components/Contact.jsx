    <p>
      I am a self-motivated and goal orientated individual with a degree
      in Computer Science from Kigali Independent University.
      I have worked on a variety of fullstack projects when studied at Microverse and
      now open to fulltime opportunities. I have a demonstrated history
      of both leading and working in teams, along with good time management
      skills. I enjoy learning new skills and am constantly expanding my
      current abilities.
